# Dev project idea
I'm still in the process of thinking about different ideas for my first dev project. I want to do something interesting but that is still within my skill level of just starting out. There's a cool project I saw of making a password generator. I use a password manager app to remember all my passwords, so I think a random number/symbol generator would be kind of fun to make! Another project may be to create a unit conversion program; sometimes I run into issues with converting numbers from metric units to imperial units, so that might also be useful/cool to do, plus I have an idea of how that would be done based on what we've already done in class. But I'm sure I'll have a better idea of what I want to do after working through a few more of Dr. Angela's days of coding.
