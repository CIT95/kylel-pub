# Learn Together Week 4
For this learn together, i decided to create a Daily Mixtape Mixer, kind of like what Spotify's Daily Mix does (albeit much simpler). It picks out random songs from a user-inputed list for each day of the week. I find that sometimes I don't know what to listen to or I want to try a new way of listening to tracks without using the shuffle feature. Plus, the little affirmations for each different mood/time make me feel good when listening to my favorite tracks! This took me quite awhile and I'm pretty sure I caught a lot of the bugs/errors, but there might be a few I missed. It was challenging but felt awesome that I now have a working playlist recommender!
